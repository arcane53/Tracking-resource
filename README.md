# Project: Resource Landing Pages

This project consists of three interconnected HTML pages designed to introduce a resource, facilitate its download, and provide a thank you message to users. The pages are styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern and responsive design.

## File Structure

## Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.

  * **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

  * **Google Fonts (Inter):** For a clean and modern typography.

## Setup and Usage

To view these pages, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Save the files:**

      * Save the content of the landing page as `index.html`.

      * Save the content of the download page as `download.html`.

      * Save the content of the thank you page as `thankyou.html`.

      * Ensure all three files are in the same directory.

2.  **Open in Browser:**

      * Open `index.html` directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking the file).

3.  **Navigation (Placeholder):**

      * Currently, the form on `index.html` does not have backend functionality to process the form submission. To simulate the flow:

          * After "submitting" the form on `index.html`, you would typically redirect to `thankyou.html`.

          * From `thankyou.html`, you might link to `download.html` (or include the download directly in the thank you email).

          * The "Download Now" button on `download.html` uses `href="#"` and `download="web-development-guide.pdf"` as placeholders. You'll need to replace `#` with the actual URL of your resource (e.g., a PDF file, ZIP file) and ensure the `download` attribute specifies the correct filename.

## Customization

  * **Content:** Easily update the text within each `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<h2>`, and `<li>` tag to match your specific resource and messaging.

  * **Colors:** Modify the Tailwind CSS `bg-gradient-to-br` classes on the `<body>` tag and the `bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r` classes on headings and buttons to change the color schemes. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-gradient) for more gradient options.

  * **Resource Links:**

      * On `download.html`, update `href="#"` in the download button's `<a>` tag to the actual URL of your downloadable resource.

      * On `thankyou.html`, update the `href="#"` values for the additional resource links (`Our Blog`, `Free Web Development Tools`, `Upcoming Webinars & Workshops`) to point to your relevant pages.

  * **Form Submission:** For a functional form, you would need to integrate a backend solution (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP) or a third-party form service to handle the email collection and subsequent actions (like sending the download link).
